abstract = {With the increasing demand for data communication services, the single satellite working mode cannot meet the needs of increasingly robust communication services. Therefore, providing multiple satellite networks for data communication services has become a trend of future communications, and the satellite communication environment has a network Topology dynamic changes, intermittent link interruption, delay and other characteristics, resulting in terrestrial Internet protocol cannot be used in space communications, this selection of CCSDS for SPP and AOS protocol for space communication protocol software simulation to test This protocol stack is used for the feasibility and performance of satellite network communications. The main contents of this paper include satellite network scene modeling, intra-network node process modeling and protocol modeling, as well as testing the retransmission mechanism and priority functions, as well as bandwidth utilization and throughput.},
